Learning the basics of PHP!

As I delve into learning PHP, I've explored a diverse range of fundamental concepts including arrays, conditionals, cookies, exceptions, file handling & uploading, and object-oriented programming (OOP). Utilizing this knowledge, I embarked on constructing a feedback application, for my baking! Using XAMPP, I established a local server environment, integrating a MySQL database to both store and retrieve user feedback submitted through the app. Implementing modular design principles, I employed separate header and footer components across the various pages, ensuring consistency and enhancing maintainability throughout the index.php, about.php, and feedback.php pages. This journey demonstrates my commitment to mastering PHP while building practical, real-world applications.
